# RC Vehicle Control System

A wireless remote control system for multiple RC vehicles using ESP32 microcontrollers with ESP-NOW communication protocol. The system supports controlling different vehicle types (excavator, dump truck, semi-trailer, and forklift) from a single base station controller.

## System Overview

This project implements a **one-to-many** wireless control system where:
- **Base Station**: Receives input from a Bluetooth controller and broadcasts commands via ESP-NOW
- **Vehicle Receivers**: Each vehicle has an ESP32 that receives commands and controls motors/servos
- **Controller Support**: Xbox and PS4/DualShock controllers supported
- **Multi-Vehicle**: Switch between vehicles using controller buttons

## Hardware Requirements

### Base Station
- ESP32 Development Board
- Bluetooth controller (Xbox or PS4/DualShock)

### Each Vehicle
- ESP32 Development Board  
- Vehicle-specific components as designed by ProfessorBoots
- Motor drivers, servo motors, sensors (per vehicle design)

**For detailed hardware specifications, wiring diagrams, and build instructions:**
- **Website**: [professorboots.com](https://professorboots.com/)
- **GitHub**: [ProfessorBoots GitHub](https://github.com/ProfBoots)

## Software Setup

### Prerequisites
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) installed
- ESP32 development environment configured

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd BootCamp
   ```

2. **Configure controller type** (base station):
   Edit `src/base.cpp` and select your controller:
   ```cpp
   // For Xbox controllers:
   #define CONTROLLER_XBOX     
   // #define CONTROLLER_PS4   
   
   // For PS4 controllers:
   // #define CONTROLLER_XBOX     
   #define CONTROLLER_PS4   
   ```

3. **Build and upload base station:**
   ```bash
   pio run -e base --target upload
   ```

4. **Build and upload vehicle firmware:**
   ```bash
   # For excavator:
   pio run -e excavator --target upload
   
   # For dump truck:
   pio run -e dump --target upload
   
   # For semi-trailer:
   pio run -e semi --target upload
   
   # For forklift:
   pio run -e fork --target upload
   ```

## Usage

### Controller Operations

#### **Basic Vehicle Control**
- **Left Stick**: Primary movement (forward/backward, steering)
- **Right Stick**: Secondary functions (varies by vehicle)
- **D-Pad**: Auxiliary functions
- **Shoulder Buttons**: Additional controls
- **Face Buttons**: Vehicle-specific functions

#### **Vehicle Switching**
Use the misc buttons on your controller to switch between vehicles:
- **Forward Button**: Next vehicle (increment receiver index)
- **Backward Button**: Previous vehicle (decrement receiver index)
- **Reset Button**: Return to receiver index 0

**Button Mappings:**
- **Xbox**: Guide button area controls
- **PS4**: Share/Options/PS button controls

## Communication Protocol

### ESP-NOW Message Structure
```cpp
typedef struct {
    uint32_t receiverIndex;    // Vehicle identifier (0-6)
    uint16_t buttons;          // Button state bitmask
    uint8_t dpad;             // D-pad state
    int32_t axisX, axisY;     // Left stick values
    int32_t axisRX, axisRY;   // Right stick values  
    uint32_t brake, throttle; // Trigger values
    uint16_t miscButtons;     // Misc button bitmask
    bool thumbR, thumbL;      // Thumb button states
    bool r1, l1, r2, l2;     // Shoulder button states
} struct_message;
```

### Receiver Indices
- **0**: No vehicle selected
- **1**: Excavator
- **2**: Forklift  
- **3**: Dump Truck
- **4**: Semi-Trailer
- **5**: Crane *(Coming Soon)*
- **6**: SkidSteer *(Coming Soon)*

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Controller not connecting:**
- Ensure correct controller type is selected in `base.cpp`
- Check Bluetooth pairing
- Verify ESP32 is in pairing mode

**Vehicle not responding:**
- Check receiver index matches vehicle
- Verify ESP-NOW initialization
- Check power supply to vehicle ESP32

**Inconsistent control:**
- Check for controller drift (calibration may be needed)
- Verify signal strength between base and vehicle
- Check for interference

### Debug Information

Monitor serial output for debugging:
```bash
pio device monitor -e base
```

The base station outputs:
- Controller connection status
- Button mappings being used
- Receiver index changes
- ESP-NOW transmission status

## Development

### Adding New Vehicles

1. **Create new source file** in `src/` directory
2. **Add environment** to `platformio.ini`:
   ```ini
   [env:newvehicle]
   platform = espressif32@6.10.0
   board = esp32doit-devkit-v1
   framework = arduino
   build_src_filter = +<newvehicle.cpp>
   lib_deps = 
     madhephaestus/ESP32Servo @ 3.0.6
   ```
3. **Implement ESP-NOW receiver** following existing patterns
4. **Set unique receiver index**
5. **Implement vehicle-specific control logic**

### Code Conversion Notes

The original project used Arduino `.ino` files with direct Bluetooth controller connections. This has been converted to:
- **PlatformIO C++ structure** for better organization
- **ESP-NOW communication** for multi-vehicle support
- **Centralized base station** for controller management

## Hardware Connections

### Pin Assignments

**For detailed wiring diagrams and pin assignments:**
- **Website**: [professorboots.com](https://professorboots.com/)
- **GitHub**: [ProfessorBoots GitHub](https://github.com/ProfBoots)

**Common ESP32 Pins:**
- Motor control: Various GPIO pins (vehicle-specific)
- Servo control: PWM-capable pins  
- I2C (if used): GPIO 21 (SDA), GPIO 22 (SCL)
- Status LED: GPIO 2 (built-in)

**Pin assignments for each vehicle type are documented in the respective source files and ProfessorBoots' vehicle designs.**

## Safety Considerations

- **Always test in safe environment** before full operation
- **Ensure emergency stop capability** 
- **Check battery levels** before operation
- **Verify control response** after any changes
- **Maintain clear line of sight** for ESP-NOW communication
